This is an attempt to resolve the Items below as a code challenge


1 - Write an API endpoint that accepts a GitHub ID and returns Follower GitHub IDâ€™s 
(up to 5 Followers total) associated with the passed in GitHub ID.  
Retrieve data up to 3 levels deep, repeating the process of retrieving Followers 
(up to 5 Followers total) for each Follower found.  Data should be returned in JSON format.


2 - Write an API endpoint that accepts a GitHub ID and retrieves the Repository names 
(up to 3 Repositories total) associated with the passed in GitHub ID


This is a spring Boot project

To try it out

you can clone the project and run it locally

the URL for the endpoint to retrieve followers of a given github ID is
http://localhost:2019/githubID/followers

Example URL : http://localhost:2019/latifbenzzine/followers
where latifbenzzine is github ID.


to retrieve the repos associated with a give github ID
the URL is http://localhost:2019/githubID/repos

Example URL : http://localhost:2019/latifbenzzine/repos

In both cases the output is JSON Format with the github ID (Also known as login)

for the followers and the name of the repo in the second case.
